## Task Breakdown

### Overview
This task involves building a Spring Boot native image using GraalVM and packaging it in a minimal Docker container (scratch or distroless) for production use. The goal is to create a lightweight, secure, and efficient deployment of the Spring PetClinic application with a reduced footprint and faster startup time.

### Task Instructions
The implementation should focus on creating an optimized native binary using GraalVM and packaging it in a minimal Docker container. Special attention should be paid to proper configuration of the native image build process and ensuring the container has all necessary dependencies while maintaining a minimal footprint.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Configure GraalVM Native Image Build**
   - Configure the native-maven-plugin in pom.xml with appropriate options
   - Ensure all necessary runtime hints are provided for reflection, resources, and serialization
   - Set up build profiles to simplify the native image build process

2. **Create Minimal Dockerfile**
   - Create a multi-stage Dockerfile with GraalVM build stage and minimal runtime stage
   - Use distroless or scratch as the base image for the runtime container
   - Configure proper permissions, user, and security settings
   - Set up appropriate ENTRYPOINT and CMD configurations
   - Expose necessary ports (8080)

3. **Optimize Native Image Configuration**
   - Configure memory limits and garbage collection settings
   - Add necessary system properties for optimal performance
   - Include required native libraries and dependencies
   - Configure proper timezone and locale settings

4. **Implement Container Security Best Practices**
   - Run the application as a non-root user
   - Apply principle of least privilege
   - Remove unnecessary tools and libraries
   - Configure read-only filesystem where possible

5. **Create Build and Run Scripts**
   - Create a script to build the native image
   - Create a script to build the Docker image
   - Create a script to run the containerized application
   - Document the build and run process

6. **Implement Testing Strategy**
   - Create tests to verify the native image functionality
   - Test the containerized application
   - Verify performance metrics (startup time, memory usage)
   - Test container security

7. **Implement Container Registry Integration**
   - Configure Docker image tagging
   - Set up authentication for container registry
   - Create push script for Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry
   - Document the registry integration process

8. **Kubernetes Deployment (Optional Extension)**
   - Create Kubernetes deployment YAML
   - Configure resource limits and requests
   - Set up health checks and probes
   - Document the Kubernetes deployment process
