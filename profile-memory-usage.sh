# Spring PetClinic Memory Usage Comparison

## Methodology
- Memory usage was measured every second for 30 seconds after application startup
- Both RSS (Resident Set Size) and VSZ (Virtual Memory Size) were recorded
- A load test was performed by hitting the /vets endpoint 50 times

## Results

### Initial Memory Usage (after startup)
$(awk -F, 'NR==2 {printf "| JVM | %.2f MB | %.2f MB |\n", $2, $3}' memory-jvm.csv)
$(awk -F, 'NR==2 {printf "| Native | %.2f MB | %.2f MB |\n", $2, $3}' memory-native.csv)

### Peak Memory Usage
$(awk -F, 'BEGIN {max_rss=0; max_vsz=0} {if ($2>max_rss) max_rss=$2; if ($3>max_vsz) max_vsz=$3} END {printf "| JVM | %.2f MB | %.2f MB |\n", max_rss, max_vsz}' memory-jvm.csv)
$(awk -F, 'BEGIN {max_rss=0; max_vsz=0} {if ($2>max_rss) max_rss=$2; if ($3>max_vsz) max_vsz=$3} END {printf "| Native | %.2f MB | %.2f MB |\n", max_rss, max_vsz}' memory-native.csv)

## Memory Usage Over Time

To visualize the memory usage over time, you can create a chart using the data in the CSV files:
- memory-jvm.csv
- memory-native.csv

## Analysis

### JVM Memory Characteristics
- Higher initial memory footprint due to JVM overhead
- Memory usage increases during warm-up phase
- More memory allocated for future growth (larger heap)
- Garbage collection affects memory usage patterns

### Native Image Memory Characteristics
- Lower initial memory footprint
- More stable memory usage over time
- Less overhead from runtime components
- No JIT compiler or class loading overhead
- More predictable memory usage patterns

## Conclusion

The GraalVM native image generally shows a smaller memory footprint compared to the JVM version, especially at startup. This makes it particularly well-suited for containerized environments and serverless platforms where memory usage directly impacts cost.

The JVM version, while using more memory, benefits from adaptive memory management that can optimize for long-running applications. For short-lived processes or memory-constrained environments, the native image offers clear advantages in terms of efficiency.

These memory usage characteristics, combined with the startup time differences documented in the startup comparison report, provide a comprehensive view of the performance tradeoffs between JVM and native image deployments.
